2020-05-25 06:57:33	akemrir	hi, where I can find how to connect to vpn using strongswan in netctl? I have certificates and settings, but I don't know where to start.
2020-05-25 06:57:55	grawity	start with... not using netctl for this task
2020-05-25 06:58:05	sheep	I don't think netctl has integration with strongswan
2020-05-25 06:58:14	ghostrider	why netctl hate? curious
2020-05-25 06:58:51	akemrir	too complicated on netctl? openconnect was very easy to tunnel on tun interface
2020-05-25 06:59:00	akemrir	with netctl of course
2020-05-25 06:59:11	grawity	you know, when you jump to conclusions like that...
2020-05-25 06:59:16	sheep	how did you set up openconnect with nectl?
2020-05-25 06:59:50	sheep	is netctl itself managing the openconnect connection?
2020-05-25 07:00:22	grawity	IMHO, strongswan (IPSec) is a bit of a confusing mess in general, and it really doesn't help that it wasn't ever built with tunnel-type VPNs in mind – that's kinda bolted on, or I'd even say "stuck on with chewing-gum"
2020-05-25 07:00:48	grawity	so if you directly write a swanctl.conf then at least you can make use of strongswan's regular documentation and IRC channel

2020-05-25 07:02:54	sheep	iirc strongswan doesn't create a separate interface
2020-05-25 07:03:02	grawity	that's one of the issues
2020-05-25 07:03:17	grawity	you *could* make it use xfrmi interfaces somehow, but probably not via charon-cmd
2020-05-25 07:03:46	akemrir	yeah, I don't have a choice with server, I'am on client side only

2020-05-25 07:06:25	sheep	you may want to consider networkmanager
2020-05-25 07:06:31	akemrir	and yes, netctl is managing connection allowing for me to connect to hosts on vpn
2020-05-25 07:07:27	akemrir	I've seen addon for networkmanager, maybe that would do the job, I'll took this into account too
