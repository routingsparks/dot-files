2020-05-05 09:51:58	N0AW	generally, it seemed fine, just that one stupid bug
2020-05-05 09:52:11	N0AW	been trying to test out kc2g's linux flex tools and that sucked
2020-05-05 09:52:37	@w0cdt	I'd be interested in what the experience is with the new apt/zfs snapshot integration

2020-05-05 09:53:17	@w0cdt	so you can roll back if something goes wrong
2020-05-05 09:53:20	@w0cdt	sort of like zypper/btrfs

2020-05-05 09:54:05	+DL5GU	yeah, pacman ain't great
2020-05-05 09:54:31	@KK0ECT	w0cdt: right i was looking at that and id basically have to wipe and re-install if i wanted to do zfs
2020-05-05 09:54:39	@KK0ECT	which is annoying
2020-05-05 09:54:48	+DL5GU	I liked pamac

2020-05-05 09:56:10	N0AW	that's a big change
2020-05-05 09:56:14	@w0cdt	I don't know how well Canonical is going to be at maintaining zfs patches in-kernel
2020-05-05 09:56:16	N0AW	that would be a reformat and new install
2020-05-05 09:56:27	@w0cdt	given Canonical's love of NIH syndrome followed by abandonment
2020-05-05 09:57:26	@ns7i	i'm on 20.04

2020-05-05 10:41:48	kennylevinsen	For example, you don't have $PATH. You have a single folder, /bin. Need more stuff accessible? Stack more things on top of it with a bind mount.
