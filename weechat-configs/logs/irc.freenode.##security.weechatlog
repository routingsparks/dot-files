2020-05-24 21:48:49	gorditto	please dont suggest airgap
2020-05-24 21:49:03	ajak	that is obviously the best option
2020-05-24 21:49:31	gorditto	just want to harden my system and learn about what i might have overlooked
2020-05-24 21:49:34	calmclam	the art of war - sun tzu
2020-05-24 21:49:39	gorditto	read it
2020-05-24 21:49:45	gorditto	lols
2020-05-24 21:49:50	gorditto	nice retort
2020-05-24 21:50:06	ajak	google "hardening $distro" maybe?
2020-05-24 21:50:43	calmclam	all warfare is based on deception
2020-05-24 21:50:48	gorditto	discerning quality from muck is hard when you don't know your ass from ur elbow
2020-05-24 21:51:11	ajak	nice retort, but sounds like you should get to reading from that
2020-05-24 21:51:22	ajak	what distro are you on?
2020-05-24 21:51:28	@nate	gorditto: Literally keeping shit mostly secure is a few fundamentals; Keep things up to date, firewall the shit out of everything, don't be a stupid user (ie; don't run random shit, don't use insecure software/mechanisms/etc)

2020-05-24 21:52:44	@nate	There's not really much magic to it beyond that, if you look at most major breaches online it's because some derpy nerp was like "nah we're fine rolling this glaringly insecure remotely exploitable stuff until budget allows fixing"
