2020-05-24 21:18:59	@ada	Smashcat: the container's lifecycle is tied to the CMD/ENTRYPOINT
2020-05-24 21:19:42	@ada	Smashcat: the intent is that one long-running process is the PID1 for that container, and when it exits the container exits
2020-05-24 21:20:13	Smashcat	ada: In my case I just want to run a linux image, which will be running other processes. But docker just exits immediately. I don't need a shell, or command to run when it starts
2020-05-24 21:20:24	@ada	Smashcat: that sounds like the "VM model"
2020-05-24 21:20:37	@ada	which is the opposite of the intent for Docker's brand of containers, at least
2020-05-24 21:21:04	@ada	if you really really need to do this, you could run a terminal with the --interactive and --tty flags like docker run -it ubuntu

2020-05-24 21:21:06	Smashcat	Oh, I thought docker could be used to create images to deploy on cloud servers. I'll take a look at VMs instead
2020-05-24 21:21:13	@ada	it can, but not VMs
2020-05-24 21:21:25	@ada	you deploy containers, and a container is written for 1 process
2020-05-24 21:21:35	@ada	you might deploy a set of related containers that talk to each other to deploy a whole app
2020-05-24 21:21:40	@ada	but there is not a whole OS inside that container,
2020-05-24 21:21:58	@ada	only the libs required to run your process and the process itself, at a basic level
2020-05-24 21:22:10	Smashcat	So I should create 1 container for apache, another for mysql, another for mail, andother for node etc. Instead of a single server with all of them?
2020-05-24 21:22:24	@ada	you would, yes

2020-05-24 21:26:33	enderandpeter	A single server could have all the containers for those services, or the containers could be on different host machines. Yes, to manage a number of services via docker, I would first get a handle of managing any one of them, and then tie them together with docker-compose.
2020-05-24 21:26:40	@ada	Smashcat: idk exactly what seems like "massive overhead" to running a group of processes together

2020-05-24 21:27:20	@ada	Smashcat: you don't need to "build" the images yourself, for the most part; there is a very well supported set of them on dockerhub for re-use

2020-05-24 21:27:36	@ada	Smashcat: you don't need to figure out how to put apache into a container, just get your site code mounted and you're good to go
2020-05-24 21:27:52	@ada	Smashcat: mysql is already containerized, too, you just provide your passwords and feed data into it
2020-05-24 21:27:56	Smashcat	I think the overhead is the aded layer of isolation between processes that don't need to be isolated. For example, mysql is much faster using a socket on the filesystem, instead of a network port. So having apache/php/mysql in the same machien is faster than isolating them all
2020-05-24 21:28:09	@ada	Smashcat: you could still use a socket for IPC
2020-05-24 21:28:13	enderandpeter	Smashcat: Yeah, totally. You should find images on docker hub for those services and then get used to how to interact with them independently to get a feel for how you'd tie them together.

2020-05-24 21:28:57	@ada	Smashcat: nothing about containers means they aren't on tyhe same machine
2020-05-24 21:29:02	@ada	Smashcat: its just a process isolation technique
2020-05-24 21:29:09	@ada	Smashcat: you could run docker containers in a VM environment for instance
2020-05-24 21:29:14	@ada	Smashcat: it's just a fancy way to run a process
2020-05-24 21:29:34	enderandpeter	Smashcat: There are definitely pros and cons to different approaches. Having your DB and web app on the same instance comes with some issues that a separate DB instance alleviates.
2020-05-24 21:29:37	@ada	Smashcat: no they have isolated filesystems by nature, but there is a sharing mechanism
2020-05-24 21:29:49	Shaun	overhead is unintuitive - it's really worth trying rather than assuming
2020-05-24 21:30:00	enderandpeter	Smashcat, yes they can share a common filesystem with volumes
2020-05-24 21:30:03	@ada	well I admit that there is a learning curve
2020-05-24 21:30:26	Smashcat	Ok cool - I've only started looking at it today. I'm a hardware developer (C/C++/ASM) but just need to get a server up for testing some devices I'm working on. This seems like overkill though for what I need :)
2020-05-24 21:30:27	@ada	there is a mental overhead of learning all these things
2020-05-24 21:30:34	@ada	Smashcat: maybe, maybe not
2020-05-24 21:30:38	@ada	Smashcat: I don't really know your needs

2020-05-24 21:30:56	enderandpeter	Smashcat: Yes, there is a learning curve for sure. I strongly recommend that you keep reading the docs because you will see many examples of the kind of thing you are talking about.
2020-05-24 21:31:02	@ada	Smashcat: for your use case, the better user-story might be what if you want to run 12 different versions of teh C++ compiler at teh same time
2020-05-24 21:31:08	@ada	Smashcat: without having to install dependencies on your host
2020-05-24 21:31:55	@ada	Smashcat: you could do that with containers pretty easily and spit out a binary compiled from various versions, without having anything "installed" on your host. the container could just be used as a way to deliver you the tools that you need

2020-05-24 21:32:10	Smashcat	One compiler can cause more than enough trouble :)
2020-05-24 21:32:12	@ada	Smashcat: python, for instance, you could run both py2 and py3 runtimes at teh same time without having to install either on the host
2020-05-24 21:32:20	@ada	Smashcat: same for ruby

2020-05-24 21:33:29	@ada	maybe /etc/lighttpd does not exist yet?
2020-05-24 21:33:38	impermanence	it does
2020-05-24 21:33:42	Smashcat	Cool, I see it as version/process management. Allowing many instances of the same software to exist in isolation.
2020-05-24 21:33:52	impermanence	I verified via a simple ls

2020-05-24 21:44:13	impermanence	yep
2020-05-24 21:44:27	impermanence	is that normal docker behavior?  can't write over an already existing file?
