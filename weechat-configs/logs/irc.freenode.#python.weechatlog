2020-05-26 19:22:11	literallyCrevice	Hey, is there some way to interface with the parser in order to get its output? For example, given the python line 'a = 2; a * 3 # should be 6' I'm trying to split it into the actual command and the comment.
2020-05-26 19:22:19	lenochka	the testing framework apparently creates another task (which is for the test, I guess), so it messes with my cancellation

2020-05-26 19:24:53	altendky	lenochka: 1) if you can't test the code it's often not in the form it should be.  2) if you need to be able to cancel a task then the thing that creates it should 'return' it to the caller so the caller can cancel it.  3) don't lie

2020-05-26 19:27:41	lenochka	:D
2020-05-26 19:27:45	_habnabit	literallyCrevice, so, python's parser (like many languages' parsers) strip out comments and whitespace very early on. you need a very specific kind of parser to handle that
2020-05-26 19:27:55	nedbat	literallyCrevice: but isn' the big challenge to get the text into python? I don't see how the python parser will help

2020-05-26 19:29:05	graingert	so many times people ask "why is my code behaving oddly?" "all it does is frobnicate the field sensor"
2020-05-26 19:29:06	literallyCrevice	nedbat: Most of the escaping (or rather, lack of parsing) magic is handled by zsh
2020-05-26 19:29:25	graingert	then after an hour of squeezing their code from them like blood from a stone
2020-05-26 19:29:35	nedbat	literallyCrevice: right, and then what more do you need to happen? Why do you need to get the text of the comments?
