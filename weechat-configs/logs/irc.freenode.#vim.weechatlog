2020-05-26 19:17:15	Intelo	Is it a good idea to use set wildignore+=*/node_modules/*,*/.git/*,*/vendor/*,*/tmp/*,*/dist/*,*/coverage/* ?   a) will all plugins ignore these? b) well some times I might need to browse node_modules or dist. In that case, Nerdtree or any won't work. Right? Whats the best approace?

2020-05-26 19:30:13	nickspoon	Hmm, I don't actually have .git in my wildignore, but I don't really see tpope's point there - you can just :e .git/config and it will work fine, wildignore doesn't affect that
